# 2022-Season
Our code for the FRC 2022 Season, Rapid React.

The code is somewhat documented. Explained in a comment in [Robot.java](https://github.com/frc8840/2022-Season/blob/main/src/main/java/frc/robot/Robot.java), we had a few misunderstandings which led to some messy code. We'll reuse some of this next year (like GameController.java or MotorManager.java) since they were built to be reused.  

This is supposed to be used with a Joystick and a Game Controller (Xbox, Logitech), with 7 speed controllers, four for the drive train, 1 for the arm, another for the intake, and another for a winch, plus a camera to watch the winch.
